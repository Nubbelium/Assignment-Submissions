</br><p>This image depicts the Limbo Boy ripping the final legs of the mother spider so that he could use its body to cross a spiked chasm (very cruel)</p>

<h4 id="brbbackgroundb"></br><b>Reflection</b></h4>

</br><p>Instead of reflecting on the game itself, I want to talk about my personal expirience with the scene that occured in front of me. Throughout the entire course of the game until now, I saw the stillness of the world, the monsters and most importantly the other children, out to kill my character. Through these expiriences, I thought myself to be playing the role of an innocent boy simply trying to make it out alive.</p>
</br><p>Due to this, I ended up placing alot of myself in this boys actions and motivations, akin to the concept of Lacan's Mirror; but the reason why this scene struck such a strong emotion with me is the breaking of that phenomenon.</p>
</br><p>So now to talk about this scene, what happened here is that the Limbo Boy realized that the only way to cross the spiked chasm is to rip the final leg off the spider and push its corpse into the hole; all in order to let him jump across. This was something I could not possibly expect the boy to do. There was no reason or motivation that coudl've possibly justified this action within myself, and in that moment it was the first time my reflection in him completely disappeared, in a complete shock, I think I felt forcefully ejected from the mirror phenomenon. It was quite an intresting think to think about.</p>
