</br><p>This image depicts the Limbo Boy ripping the final legs of the mother spider so that he could use its body to cross a spiked chasm (very cruel)</p>

<h4 id="brbbackgroundb"></br><b>Assignment 1: Reflection</b></h4>

</br><p>Instead of reflecting on the game itself, I want to talk about my experience with the scene that occurred in front of me. Throughout the entire course of the game until now, I saw the stillness of the world, the monsters, and most importantly the other children, out to kill my character. Through these experiences, I thought myself to be playing the role of an innocent boy simply trying to make it out alive.</p>
</br><p>Due to this, I ended up placing a lot of myself in this boy's actions and motivations, akin to the concept of Lacan's Mirror; but the reason why this scene struck such strong emotion with me is the breaking of that phenomenon.</p>
</br><p>So now to talk about this scene, what happened here is that the Limbo Boy realized that the only way to cross the spiked chasm is to rip the final leg off the spider and push its corpse into the hole; all to let him jump across. This was something I could not possibly expect the boy to do. No reason or motivation could've possibly justified this action within me, and at that moment it was the first time my reflection in him completely disappeared, in a complete shock, I think I felt forcefully ejected from the mirror phenomenon. It was quite an interesting thing to think about.</p></br></br>

<h4 id="brbbackgroundb"></br><b>Assignment 2: Thesis</b></h4>

</br><p>Thesis: I believe the peresonal expirience I've had with the game: Mirror Stage, is an essential expirience. One that immerses oneself in the world of limbo, and more importantly, the breaking such a phenomenon, the so called "Forceful ejection" from the mirror is just as important as the immersion itself.</p>

</br><p>As a quick summary, Lacan's theory of the mirror stage covers the 6 to 18 months of baby development. Its the exploration of identifying ones self in another. With the concept of "I" and "them" mixed, until development has reached the point where the child can distinguish from both. The concept itself introduces my theories about the differences between oneself and the world and people around them as well as the split beetween the ego and the body.</p>

</br><p>Its not an exgaeration to say that immersion is one of the most important parts of Limbo's world, from the very beginning the game makes quite a an active effort in order to get you to play the part of the Limbo Boy. Even without playing, once quick snapshot of its atmosphere is enough to let you feel this world.</p>

</br></br><img src="./assets/picture1.png" alt="Atmosphere of Limbo">

</br></br><p>Just a few examples of this immersion is in the danger that your character gets placed into, as well as the fade out to black that occurs when your player dies. The dying of the eyes and the fading to black, as no crys from the boy are made, let you feel the cruelness of the world that your character is faced with and gets you rooting for him.</p>

</br></br><img style="text-align: center" src="./assets/gif1.gif" alt="Death of Limbo Boy">

</br></br><p>I found that this leads into this mindset of "How would I act in this situation" and once the player is put through something challenging, like running away from a mother spider, that is when the player is the most immersed. Its when fear of dying is the highest, and the cruel anxiety and eariness of the world truly impacting not just the Limbo Boy, but the player controlling him.</p>
</br><p>Now all of these things are merly just observations, but these observations lead to a more intresting conculsion once we start talking about the breaking of the immersion.</p>
</br><p>While it is ideal that a game such as this one would try to keep its player immersed in its experience for its entirety, even the best games fail to meet such an impossible challenge. Some sections of puzzles or chases wont be able to hook everyone in, due to all players individual uniqueness, but I think the Limbo developers realized this and took advantage of it.</p>
</br><p>Through my playthrough of the game, I realized that the developers had attempted to recreate the expirience I had described in the first assignment many more times throughout the entire game. And after finishing the game and seeing its very sad ending, I found the answer I was looking for.</p>
