<h4 id="brbbackgroundb"></br><b>Introduction</b></h4>

</br><p>My thesis began with my personal reflection after finishing the game, and this scene depicted above showed a very common situation I found myself in: Just to preface, throughout the entire course of the game until now, I saw the stillness of the world, the monsters, and most importantly the other children, out to kill my character. Through these experiences, I thought myself to be playing the role of an innocent boy simply trying to make it out alive. Due to this, I ended up placing a lot of myself in this boy's actions and motivations. </p>
</br><p>So now to talk about this scene, what happened here is that the Limbo Boy realized that the only way to cross the spiked chasm is to rip the final leg off the spider and push its corpse into the hole; all to let him jump across. This was something I could not possibly expect the boy to do. No reason or motivation could've possibly justified this action within me, and at that moment it was the first time my reflection in him completely disappeared, in a complete shock, I think I felt forcefully ejected from the mirror phenomenon. It was quite an interesting thing to think about.</p>
</br><p>My thesis is an exploration of how this tiny experience within the larger game has impacted my enjoyment and how the developers might have intended for someone like me to have this experience in the first place.</p></br></br>

<h4 id="brbbackgroundb"></br><b>Thesis</b></h4>

</br><p>I believe the personal experience I've had with the game: Mirror Stage, is an essential experience. One that immerses oneself in the world of Limbo, and more importantly, the breaking such a phenomenon, the so-called "Forceful ejection" from the mirror is just as important as the immersion itself; that an experience like this can only be possible with the methods provided by the developers of Limbo.</p>

</br><p>As a quick summary, <i>Lacan's theory of the mirror stage covers the 6 to 18 months of baby development. It's the exploration of identifying one's self in another. With the concept of "I" and "them" mixed, until development has reached the point where the child can distinguish from both. The concept itself introduces my theories about the differences between oneself and the world and people around them as well as the split between the ego and the body.</i></p>

</br><p>It is not an exaggeration to say that immersion is one of the most important parts of Limbo's world, from the very beginning the game makes quite an active effort in order to get you to play the part of the Limbo Boy. Even without playing, one quick snapshot of its atmosphere is enough to let you feel this world.</p>

</br></br><img src="./assets/picture1.png" alt="Atmosphere of Limbo">

</br></br><p>To break this scene down, there are three crucial aspects that immerse you in Limbo. First the visuals, or in this context: the atmosphere. The combination of layered effects alongside the dark atmosphere with little to no visual information given at a time makes this world very imaginative, meaning it leaves a lot of its world to your imagination whilst not depriving you of basic worldbuilding aspects like the blurry background implying more. This leads to the second, gameplay and animation.</p>

</br></br><img style="text-align: center" src="./assets/gif1.gif" alt="Death of Limbo Boy" width="840" height="480">

</br></br><p>This scene depicts the Limbo Boy getting impaled by the mother spider after tempting its spiky legs for a little too long. There is a multitude of things going on in this short scene. Starting with the engagement. The player’s controller is clunky, slow, and delayed in a manner that invites imprecision with movements. This works both in endearing the player in the boy’s uncoordinated movements, but also adding a layer of anxiety as the Limbo Boy can easily deviate from the player’s plan. This is one of such instances, as the Limbo Boy gets killed, his eyes fade to black as he makes no cry of pain or screams for help. This makes it very easy to feel the cruelness of the world that your character is faced with and gets you rooting for him.</p>
</br><p>The last is the sound design, the developers took a similar approach to their sound design as their visual design language and atmosphere. </p></br>

</br><p>Here is the audio file was taken from that scene. Listening closely, there is a significant lack of jump or scare from the death of your character, just footsteps, the cracking of bone, then a low bass gradient. The critical lack of sound creates a gap between the expectations of the player, in this case, the expectation of a cry, assuming this is their first death, and the complete lack of sound from the boy other than the cracking of his bones. And the Sonic Visualizer seems to reflect this description.</p>

</br></br><img style="text-align: center" src="./assets/Screenshot.png" alt="Death of Limbo Boy"></br></br>

</br><p>Other than the white noise in the background, the footsteps at the start, the two cracks from the spider attack, and the low bass. This soundscape is relatively barren. The developers clearly wanted to convey the eerieness of the world through its deprivation of information. But with that in mind, why even have footsteps? The answer to this question can be found in “Reality Effect” written by Roland Barthes. </p>

</br><p><i>In his article, he speaks of two forms of elements in a story: one that is used to move the narrative forward, and one that is used for descriptions. I believe an argument can be made for both regarding the relevance of the footsteps and the cracking of bone but for the sake of this explanation, I believe that cracking bones is a required feature, as it is required to signal the boy’s death. But the footsteps are not, rather its descriptive, as defined by Barthes. So the true purpose it fulfills is to immerse the player into the world, grounding the sound in the Limbo Boy’s interaction with the world. The narrative can survive without the footsteps of the boy, but the developers decided that it was necessary for additional immersion, which leads us back to how this successful immersion guides the player’s mindset.</i></p>

</br><p><h7><q>See Barthes, Roland. "The Reality Effect" in The Rustle of Language Richard Howard (Berkeley, CA: UC Press, 1984 (1968)</q></h7> <!-- Interface instructions --></p>

</br><p>Here is all three of those aspects put together</p></br>

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tc1VZnti1rfU-tUgEXr3BWZxkaxsussN/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe></br>

</br><p>I found that this leads into this mindset of "How would I act in this situation" and once the player is put through something challenging: like running away from a mother spider, that is when the player is the most immersed. It's when fear of dying is the highest, and the cruel anxiety and eariness of the world truly impact not just the Limbo Boy, but the player controlling him.
</p>

</br><p>Now all of these things are merely just observations, but these observations lead to a more interesting conclusion once we start talking about the breaking of the immersion.</p>

</br><p>While it is ideal that a game such as this one would try to keep its player immersed in its experience for its entirety, even the best games fail to meet such an impossible challenge. Some sections of puzzles or chases won't be able to hook everyone in, due to all players' individual uniqueness, but I think the Limbo developers realized this and took advantage of it.</p>

</br><p>Through my playthrough of the game, I realized that the developers had attempted to recreate the experience I had described in the introduction many more times throughout the entire game. And after finishing the game and seeing its very sad ending, I found the answer I was looking for.</p>

</br><p>"The game makes itself stands out from most immersive narrative games because of how it plays with the immersion of the player, intentionally reconnecting and disconnecting the player from the world that they are experiencing." Here is another example for my Thesis:</p>

</br></br><img style="text-align: center" src="./assets/picture2.png" alt="Death of Limbo Boy">
</br></br><p>In this image, the player is faced with another potentially immersion-breaking situation, in order to move on, you must cruelly crush the children under a mechanical piston, killing them. While it's impossible to assume how the player will react exactly to the very cruel choice. I have a prediction on how most will interpret this.</p>

</br><p>Either they will just continue, not batting an eye and seeing it like just another puzzle to complete; or have a similar reaction to what I had in the introduction. What's important to understand is that both of these outcomes are beneficial for one gameplay experience. In the first, the player stays completely immersed in the world, and instead of being more like themselves, they start to jump into the role of the cruel Limbo boy, doing just about anything morally just to move on. While the other outcome is where I want to focus more on.</p>

</br><p>In this second outcome, the player realizes what they have done, and loses their immersion with the Limbo Boy, covering the events that occurred to me in the introduction. But there was something important in that reflection that was not covered, what happened after that scene. Well, here's what happened as a result of my "forceful ejection:" The shock from what I've just done makes me start regretting that decision I've made, and while it was horrible to do something like it, it was the only solution to the puzzle. This brings a whole rush of very powerful emotions such as confusion, disgust, and anxiety within my experience of the game. What's even more interesting than the emotions felt, is the fact that I was able to jump so quickly back into being immersed.</p>

</br><p>Like I spoke earlier, the game makes it very easy to get immersed in, this includes getting reimmersed once you get "forcefully ejected". The atmosphere, imagery, gameplay, animation, and soundscape make this more than possible. So with everything considered, the result of your immersion getting broken is that you can reflect upon the actions of your character and quickly get reimmersed in the world.</p>

</br><p>This creates a very unique gameplay loop as I spoke of earlier, where the game actively tries anything to get you immersed and simultaneously "ejecting" you from the experience to get you to reflect on the choices you had to make to even get there in the first place. This effect is very akin to repeatedly creating the "breaking of the mirror phenomenon", to the complete benefit of the game.</p>
